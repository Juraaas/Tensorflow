# Project and excercises using Tensorflow, scikit-learn and python libraries

* CNN_classifier_binary - using tinyVGG architecture classification of 2 food categories, and x-ray or non x-ray photos, including custom uploaded photos which are resized to fit existing set pictures
* bag_of_words - cleaning and preparing the text for a bag_of_words model which is then trained on Naive Bayes and multiple other classifiers
* hepatitisC - brief analysis of hepatitisC data, comparing classification results across different classifiers using basic classification metrics, statistical tests and LOOCV cross-validation with cumulative plots
* ucb - implementation of upper confidence bound algorithm for future usage in reinforcment learning problems
