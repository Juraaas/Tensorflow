# Project and excercises using Tensorflow, scikit-learn and python libraries

* CNN_classifier_binary - using tinyVGG architecture classification of 2 food categories, and x-ray or non x-ray photos, including custom uploaded photos which are resized to fit existing set pictures
* bag_of_words - cleaning and preparing the text for a bag_of_words model which is then trained on Naive Bayes and multiple other classifiers
* hepatitisC - brief analysis of hepatitisC data, comparing classification results across different classifiers using basic classification metrics, statistical tests and LOOCV cross-validation with cumulative plots
* ucb - implementation of upper confidence bound algorithm for future usage in reinforcment learning problems
* transfer_learning_in_tf - analysis and using transfer learning feature extraction + fine-tuning to achieve better results in classifying 101 food types dataset
* 07_food_vision - using effNet with mixed precision training on classifying food types
* 09_SkimLit_nlp - series of NLP model experiments used to categorizing PubMed articles into text categories as: Conclusion, Results, Objective etc.\
* 10_Time_Series_TF - series of time series modelling experiments used for trying to predict prices of cryptocurriencies
